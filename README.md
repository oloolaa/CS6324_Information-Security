# Information Security by Yinglue
These are my work on Information security course, divided into two parts.

## Cryptography
This part is all about encryption, decryption, and modes of operation.

## Project
This part is about evaluating the performance of Hydra from Kali Linux and Bro from Security Onion. Hydra is a penetration tool on a platform called Kali Linux, and Bro is an IDS from Security Onion. 

Bro needs modified scripts to run.
